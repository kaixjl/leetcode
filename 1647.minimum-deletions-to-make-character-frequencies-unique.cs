 *
 * A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that
 * have the same frequency.
 * 
 * Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete
 * to make s good.
 * 
 * The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears
 * in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2,
 * while the frequency of 'b' is 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "aab"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: s is already good.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
 * Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string
 * "aaabbc".
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "ceabaacb"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
 * Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the
 * end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * sÂ contains only lowercase English letters.
